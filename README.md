## AchievementsOf.Life

A place to document all your achievements (even the smallest ones).

## Motivation behind this.

We often forget to celebrate our small achievements (At least that's the case with me). And Whenever I feel low, I need something to look back to and say "Yes, I have achieved something in life and I'll keep grinding ‚ú®"

## How to add your achievements page?

1. Fork this repository.
2. Create a folder in `_users` folder by the name of your Github username.
3. Create a `index.md` file inside it.
4. Start adding information in the following template. For example -

```markdown
